- Shortlisted for MLH Fellowship Summer '22 under Solana Labs. I'm working with Metaplex organization as a part of it.
- Updated Metaplex SDK in React CRA5 and Vite starter guides.
- Developed example for how to simulate NFT pagination using Metaplex SDK since Solana JSON RPC does not support pagination natively.
