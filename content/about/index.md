Hello! I'm Aman, a pre Final year AI&DS Undergrad from TCET, Mumbai.

I was a Software Development Intern @ [SportVot](https://sportvot.com/) and Data Science Intern @ [SayHey](https://sayhey.co.in/). I am fortunate to be the Co founder & Vice President of [Mind Benders Club](https://linktr.ee/mbc_tcet) too. Prior to this we had qualified SIH'22 college rounds and achieved second runner up in [Android Buzz](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1sLscfRzEUMIbMmKu-wk8oe6A8aTNkoP2/view?usp=sharing) hackathon too.

Being [3 star @CodeChef](https://www.codechef.com/users/aman_offical) and [1774 @Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/SultanIndian/), I also enjoy creating things that live on the internet, whether that be websites, applications, or anything in between.
