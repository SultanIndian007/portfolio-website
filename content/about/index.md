Hello! I'm Apoorv, a Final year CSE Undergraduate from MAIT, Delhi.

I enjoy creating things that live on the internet, whether that be websites, applications, or anything in between.

I was a MLH Fellow for Summer '22 @ [Solana Labs](https://solana.com/) where I worked with [Metaplex](https://www.metaplex.com/) under Solana Ecosystem.
